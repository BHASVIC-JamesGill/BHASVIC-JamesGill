# About me

I am a computer science student from BHASVIC college.

Currently, I am working on Maths, Further Maths, Physics and Computer Science A-levels.

Inside my Computer Science A-level, I am currently working on a racing game as my project, which I will use Unity for.

I am looking to do a degree in Mathematics to help me towards a job in the quaternary sector.

I have completed 10 GCSES, including 9s in Maths and Further Maths.

I believe I have good problem solving skills which I use in all my subjects, particularly computer science. I am proficient at breaking down a problem into smaller manageable steps, then completing those to solve the overall problem.

Another skill I believe I possess is good teamwork. I am able to understand what needs to be done in a project and delegate members of a team to different tasks. In addition, I can be relied upon to complete my sections to a good standard too.

I think I have good communication skills, which I use often in Maths lessons to help people understand my method to solving a problem. Often I offer to help people if they are stuck, providing advice and different approaches to problems.
